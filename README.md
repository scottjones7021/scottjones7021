## About Me

I’m a Full Stack Developer with 10+ years of experience in web development, specializing in PHP and JavaScript. I build custom web applications, SaaS platforms, and content management systems (CMS) that are fast, secure, and user-friendly. Over the years, I’ve worked with clients across many industries, including e-commerce, healthcare, education, real estate, finance, logistics, fitness, and media.

I handle both front-end and back-end development using Laravel, WordPress, Node.js, React, Vue.js, RESTful APIs, and more. I’ve helped businesses launch new products, upgrade existing platforms, and improve the performance and usability of their websites and applications.

I also focus on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering solutions that are reliable, easy to update, and built to last. Whether you're starting from scratch or need support for an ongoing project, I’m ready to jump in. Let’s work together to bring your ideas to life!
